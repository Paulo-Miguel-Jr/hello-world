Hi, my name is Paulo Miguel, i'm from Recife - Brazil and just start learning code. I love play videogames so i got interessed in learn a little bit how they work and are made.
I started learning a bit of python and C on some coursera courses and i loved it. Now i'm trying to learn more and to use it to find a job in this area.
i'm not to good talking about myself, but i will udate this once in a while (need to improve my profile too).
